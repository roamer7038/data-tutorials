    -   [Ambari 2.5 Release Notes](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.5.0.3/bk_ambari-release-notes/content/ch_relnotes-ambari-2.5.0.3.html)


## Behavior Changes

-   New splash page
    -   Removed Falcon
    -   Added Workflow Manager


## Known Issues

-   Unable to stop/restart Oozie service using ambari
    -   Works from the command line
-   Atlas Schema Tab Doesn't Appear, So Not Able to Assign Specific Hive Columns an Tag
-   HBase RPC Bindings not configured out of box


## Limitations

This is a list of common limitations along with their workarounds.

-   RMP-3586 - Due to dependency of the underlying OS and Virtual machine application, the following may occur when suspending the virtual machine:
    -   Region Server service for HBase may be stopped when returning back from suspended state. It will need to be restarted.
    -   Ambari Metrics may be stopped when returning back from suspended state since it now uses an embedded HBase.
    -   Workaround: Avoid having to suspend your virtual machine.

## HDP Services Not Started Automatically on Startup

Because of the limited resources avaialble in the sandbox virtual machine environment, the following services are in maintenance mode and will not automatically start. To fully use these services, you must allocate more memory to the sandbox virtual machine. If you want these services to automatically start, turn off maintenance mode. The processes are listed with their main class.

-   Ambari Infra
-   Ambari Metrics
-   Atlas
    -   Main - org.apache.atlas.Main
-   HDFS
    -   SecondaryNameNode - org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.SecondaryNameNode
    -   Since on a single node, secondary namenode is not needed, it is not started.
-   Falcon
    -   Main - org.apache.falcon.Main
-   HBase
    -   HRegionServer - org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer
    -   HMaster - org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster
