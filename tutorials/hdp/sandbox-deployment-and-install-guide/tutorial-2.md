## Import the Hortonworks Sandbox

Open your VMWare product and elect to add a new virtual machine.

On Mac OSX:

Select "**Import an existing virtual machine**" and click the **Continue** button.

"**Choose File...**" to browse to and select the sandbox image you downloaded.  Click the **Continue** button.

Next, you're given the opportunity to save the virtual machine under a different name.  If you have no preference in renaming, you can just leave the default name and click Save.  You should then see the importing progress dialog:

Click the **Finish** button and start your new virtual machine.  A window opens and displays the boot process.  Once the virtual machine fully boots up, you may begin using the sandbox.
